# International-Capital-Flow
Using the Feldstein Horioka approach and the WEO data, I try to look at if the magnitude of international capital flow changes overtime by examining the relationship between investment and saving across the world during the past 3 decades. I conduct the subsample analysis by diving the country groups into old OECD countries, old+new OECD countries, and all countries and by dividing the sample periods into 1980s, 1990s and post-2000. 
I also conduct heteorgeneity analysis by looking at the English speaking countries and non-English speaking countries. 
The econometrics method used is country fixed effect.

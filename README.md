# International Capital Flow
Using the Feldstein Horioka approach and the WEO data, I try to examine if the magnitude of international capital flow changes over time by looking at the relationship between each country's investment and saving across the world during the past 3 decades. I conduct the subsample analysis by dividing the country groups into old OECD countries, old+new OECD countries, and all countries and by dividing the sample periods into the 1980s, 1990s, and post-2000. 
I also conduct a heterogeneity analysis between English-speaking countries and non-English-speaking countries. 
The main econometrics method used is country fixed effect. Work includes data transformation, merge, cleaning, econometrics analysis, and coefficients visualization.
